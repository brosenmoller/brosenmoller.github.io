            I'm a 21-year-old student a <strong>HKU in Utrecht</strong> where I study <strong>Game Development</strong>. 
            I have always loved being creative and learning new things. 
            Game development has allowed me to combine these things. 
            Now I'm dedicated to turn that passion into a career.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5">
            At HKU, I have had the opportunity to delve into many different aspects of Game Development and meet like-minded people. 
            I really enjoy learning through creating a project, which I could do a lot of here.

            After High school, I took a gap year before starting my studies. 
            This allowed me to think more about my choice and already start getting some experience. 
            I could become a Web-Developer for the company <a href="https://jilster.app/" class="fancy-link font-bold">Jilster</a>. 
            Here I created a full stack web application using Vue.js and Laravel for the Customer Service team. 
            In this year I also spend a month abroad in <strong>MÃ¼nster (Germany)</strong> where I did an internship at <a href="https://humotion.net/en/home/" class="fancy-link font-bold">Humotion</a>. 
            Here I developed a tool to register their athletic tracks on a map. 
            In both companies, I learned about working together with a team of developers using git and scrum.

            Listed below, you'll find a collection of projects I did over the past years. 
            Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. 
            I hope you enjoy browsing through my work!
