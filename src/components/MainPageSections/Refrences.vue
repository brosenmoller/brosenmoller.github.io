                    Ben started at the age of 15 in the customer service department at your Jilster. There, he very quickly became more confident in voice, which is an important part of service. I look back on that period as Jilster's end manager with great pleasure on Ben's development. He is friendly, polite and clear. He is also honest. At the time, he was allowed to praise himself more for the things that were going well.

                <p class="mt-5">
                    As he worked longer at Jilster, he got more responsibility and then started doing IT development. That is close to his best talent, so from then on, you saw his functioning and performance go up by leaps and bounds. Just as well, I'm glad Ben got to experience service functioning for a while. As an IT developer, Ben was extremely good and reliable. He developed the cockpit at Jilster. This cockpit was essential for improving the processes of the support staff. Because he had worked there himself, he knew perfectly well what was needed. We were very sorry to see him leave Jilster because of his studies in Utrecht, but were of course happy that he was going to make this step. A step towards a great future.
