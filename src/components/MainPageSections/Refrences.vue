                    As an IT developer, Ben was extremely good and reliable. He developed the cockpit at Jilster. This cockpit was essential for improving the processes of the support staff. Because he had worked there himself, he knew perfectly well what was needed. We were very sorry to see him leave Jilster because of his studies in Utrecht, but were of course happy that he was going to make this step. A step towards a great future.

                    During his internship, Mr. Rosenmöller has worked on a new web based editor tool to support internal
                    processes become more efficient. Mr. Rosenmöller's field of learning and tasks included the following:

                        <li>Web App Development using Svelte, Tailwind CSS, REST apis, JSON data structures</li>
                        <li>Version control using git</li>
                        <li>Continuous Deployment using GitLab CI/CD</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="my-5">
                    For the internship supervisors and the entire team, the presence and collaboration of Mr. Rosenmöller
                    was a great enrichment.
