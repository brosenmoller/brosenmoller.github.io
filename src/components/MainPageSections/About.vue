            I'm a 21-year-old student at <strong>HKU in Utrecht</strong>, where I study <strong>Game Development</strong>. I have always loved being creative, learning new things, working in teams and doing technical work. Game development has allowed me to combine these things. Now I'm dedicated to turn that passion into a career.

            My journey into programming began at the age of 11 with Scratch, and within a year, I transitioned to Python. After that, I wanted to go back to creating games, so I learned Unity and C#. In high school, I always thought I would go on and study physics. I would have liked studying physics, but I would miss the project based learning approach, and I noticed that my passion was Game Development. At HKU studying game development I could do both of those things.

            After High school, I took a gap year before starting my studies. 
            This allowed me to think more about my choice and already start getting some experience. 
            I could become a Web-Developer for the company <a href="https://jilster.app/" class="fancy-link font-bold">Jilster</a>. 
            Here I created a full stack web application using Vue.js and Laravel for the Customer Service team. 
            In this year I also spend a month abroad in <strong>MÃ¼nster (Germany)</strong> where I did an internship at <a href="https://humotion.net/en/home/" class="fancy-link font-bold">Humotion</a>. 
            Here I developed a tool to register their athletic tracks on a map. 
            In both companies, I learned about working together with a team of developers using git and scrum.
